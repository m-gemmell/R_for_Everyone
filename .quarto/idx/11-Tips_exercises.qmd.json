{"title":"Handy exercises","markdown":{"headingText":"Handy exercises","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/exercises.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nThere has been a lot covered this section so these exercises will hopefully be straightforward.\n\nPlease set the working directory to your main workshop directory and use your \"Exercises.R\" script. Ensure you are using annotations and code sections to keep the contents clear and separated.\n\nAdditionally **read** in and **write** out files to \"Chapter_10-11\" .\n\n## Tea exercise\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/tea.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nThe first task you will carry out is printing out information from \"tea_df\". Below is an example statement for the country Turkey:\n\n\"Turkey is the number 1 consumer of tea. It consumes 5.8kg of tea annually per capita.\"\n\nPrint out this statement for the countries Ireland, United Kingdom, France, and Australia with their relevant information. Make sure the kilogram value only has one decimal place.\n\n**Tip**: You will require the **functions** `paste()` and `round()` from day 1.\n\n## English speakers across the world exercise\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/language.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nThe last exercise is to create the following table as a **data frame** called \"english_100mil_df\". Use the \"english_complete_datasets_df\" **data frame** as a start.\n\n```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'MSc_winter_term_df'}\nlibrary(\"knitr\")\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nenglish_df <- read.csv(\"files/english_speaking_population_of_countries.tsv\", \n                   sep = \"\\t\", \n                   row.names = 1,\n                   check.names = FALSE)\nenglish_df[is.na(english_df)] <- 0\nenglish_complete_datasets_df <- \n  english_df[\n    (english_df$`As first language` + english_df$`As an additional language`) ==\n      english_df$`Total English speakers`,\n    ]\nenglish_100mil_df <- english_complete_datasets_df[english_complete_datasets_df$`Eligible population` > 100000000,]\nenglish_100mil_df$`Fraction of population that are English speakers` <- \n  english_100mil_df$`Total English speakers` /\n  english_100mil_df$`Eligible population`\nenglish_100mil_df[\"Mean\",] <- colMeans(english_100mil_df)\nenglish_100mil_df[\"Total\",1:4] <- colSums(english_100mil_df[1:7,1:4])\nenglish_100mil_df[\"Total\",\"Fraction of population that are English speakers\"] <- \n  english_100mil_df[\"Total\",\"Total English speakers\"] /\n  english_100mil_df[\"Total\",\"Eligible population\"]\n\nkbl(english_100mil_df) %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\nThe **data frame** only contains countries that have an eligible population that is greater than 100 million (100000000). Ensure the \"Total\" row was not calculated using the \"Mean row\".\n\nWhen you have created yours check it with the above one. Is your value for the \"Total\" \"Fraction of population that are English speakers\" correct?.\n\nOnce you have created the **data frame** **write** it out as a comma separated file with the function `write.table()` called \"English_top_7\\_populated_countries.csv\". Have the row and column names surrounded by quotes in your file. Make sure there is an empty value above your row names.\n\n## Extra exercise\n\n```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"figures/multiplication.png\", auto_pdf = TRUE)\n```\n\nIf you still have time this session and you do not have any questions please attempt the following task:\n\nCreate a multiplication table like the one in the practice from today. However have the row and column names equal one to twelve.\n\nThen **write** the **data frame** to a file. The name and format of the file is up to you.\n\nThere is no solution to this in the next section.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"11-Tips_exercises.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.35","editor":"source","theme":"cosmo","max-width":"3000px","toc-location":"left","toc-title":"In this chapter","margin":0,"page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

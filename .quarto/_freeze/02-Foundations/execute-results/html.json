Understanding these concepts is fundamental to becoming an R user. The section will start with **operators**, these include `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, they allow us to use R like a calculator. Then we will look at **variables**. **Variables** allow us to save the output from commands so we can use it in future commands.\n\nA lot of the power of R comes from the vast array of **functions** it contains. We will therefore look at some useful **functions** to see how they work. Additionally, we'll look at how to interact with directories in R.\n\nThe section will end showing you some ways to use RStudio and the **script editor**.\n\n## Operators\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/calculator.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Operators** are symbols in R that allow you to carry out many common tasks. The 3 main types of **operators** in R are arithmetic, logical, and bitwise. We will ignore logical and bitwise and have a look at some arithmetic **operators**.\n\nThe four most commonly used arithmetic **operators** are:\n\n-   `+` : Addition\n-   `-` : Minus\n-   `/` : Divide\n-   `*` : Multiply\n\nRun the following commands in your RStudio **console**.\n\n**Note:** Each line below represents one command. Once a command is typed out press enter to run the command.\n\n**Note:** The amount of space between the integers/numbers and an operator does not matter. It is a matter of preference and clarity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n7-7\n10/5\n3*3\n6+2+4\n8-1-3\n```\n:::\n\n\nR follows the BODMAS rules (Brackets, Orders (powers/roots), Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Try out the following commands to demonstrate the usefulness of brackets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 + 2 * 2/5\n((3+2) * 2) / 5\n3 - 2*4 + 1\n(3-2) * (4+1)\n3 * 3/2 * 2 - 1\n(3*3) / ((2*2) - 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen entering commands via the **console** the results/output is printed to the screen (ignore the \\[1\\] at the moment). However, this is no better than a normal calculator currently. R is a lot more powerful as we shall see.\n\n## Variables\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/boxes.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output/result of a command can be saved as a **variable**. Below is the format for creating a **variable** in R (don't type this into R).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvariable_name <- variable_object\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 3 parts to the above:\n\n-   The **variable name** (`variable_name`). This is the name of the **variable** and is what will be used to refer to the **variable** in future commands. This name can be almost anything. There are some rules on what can be in a name:\n\n    -   Must start with a letter.\n    -   Cannot contain spaces.\n    -   Cannot start with a number.\n    -   Cannot share the same name as a command or function in R.\n    -   They are case sensitive. The **variable** name `BB` is different to the **variable** name `bb` which is different again to `bB`. I find it easiest to keep **variable names** in lower case.\n\n-   `<-` is called the assignment **operator**. It assigns the **variable object** to the **variable name**.\n\n    -   Tip you can press 'ALT'+ '-' after a **variable name** as a shortcut for the assignment **operator**.\n\n-   The **variable object** (`variable_object`). This can be many different objects including the output/results from commands, strings/words, numbers, and many other R data types.\n\nA **variable** can be thought of as a box. The **variable object** is held in the box but it can be replaced with any other object. The **variable name** can then be thought as the label on the box so you can tell which box is which.\n\nType the below commands into the RStudio **console**.\n\n**Note.** Remember the amount of spaces between **operators** and **integers** does not matter. I encourage you to experiment with this spacing so you find what is best for you in terms of ease and clarity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbakers_dozen <- 13\nkilobyte <- 1024\nI <- 1\nII <- I + 1\nV <- 7 - II\nX <- (II / I) * V\nL <- X * V\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the above commands the **variables** are not printed out to the screen, this is as it should be. The **variables** are appearing in the **environment** pane (Top right). This is very convenient to see what variables are currently in the **environment** and to see what they contain.\n\nTo print the contents of a **variable** to screen you can type the **variable name** into the **console** and press enter. This will print the **variable object** to the screen. This is not needed for small **variable objects**, for which you can look at the **environment** pane, but is useful for larger **variable objects**.\n\n## Functions\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/function.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nR **Functions** allow the user to carry out a specific task. R has many inbuilt **functions** but you can also create your own. Currently we will look at in built functions.\n\nThe basic layout of a **function** is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunction_name(objects, options)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 3 main parts to the above:\n\n-   The **function name** (`function_name`)\n\n-   The **object/s** to provide to the **function**.\n\n    -   This can be numbers, strings, **variables** we have created etc.\n    -   Most **functions** require at least one **object**.\n    -   Some **functions** can take multiple objects, if multiple **objects** are provided they must be separated by `,`.\n\n-   **Function** options (`options`). Options can be provided to some **functions** to alter the way they will work.\n\n    -   Some **functions** don't have options.\n    -   Most options have default modes. If the options is not specified the default mode will be used.\n    -   Like **objects**, when using multiple options they must be separated by `,`.\n\nTry running the below commands in your Rstudio **console**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nceiling(3.5)\nfloor(3.5)\nsqrt(9)\nround(3.5555, digits = 2)\nround(3.5555, digits = 3)\nround(3.5555, digits = 0)\ntwo <- sqrt(4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe help page of **functions** can be accessed in 2 main ways:\n\n-   Click on the **function name** so your cursor is in it and press **F1**.\n-   Type `?` followed by the **function name**. Example below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?ceiling\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Directories\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/directories.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is important to know what directory you are working in and how to change to different directories.\n\n### Commands\n\nBelow are commands you can run in the RStudio **console** or **script editor** (use of script editor will be taught soon).\n\n-   Determine what directory you are currently in:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Set working directory. The path of the directory must be in quotes like below. If you do run the below command make sure the path exists in your computer, as I am the sure the example below will not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"/path/of/directory\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   List the files in the current directory:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist.files()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### RStudio Interface\n\nThe RStudio interface can also be used to carry out the above tasks.\n\nTo see what the current working directory is, you can look at the top bar of the **console window**. The below shows I am in the **\"F:/R/CE/CE_R\\_for_Everyone\"** directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/current_wd.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are two main ways to set your working directory.\n\n1.  Via the tool bar:\n\n    1.  Click **\"Session\"**\n    2.  Go to the **\"Set Working Directory\"** drop down section\n    3.  Click **\"Choose Directory..\"**\n    4.  Use the pop-up browser to choose a directory\n\n2.  Via the **MISC window** (bottom right)\n\n    1.  Click the **Files pane**\n    2.  Navigate to the directory you would like to set as the working directory\n    3.  On the **MISC toolbar** click **\"More\"**\n    4.  On the drop down click **\"Set As Working Directory\"**\n\nTo show the current working directory in the **Files** pane click the arrow on the top bar of the **console window**. You can then see what files and directories are in your working directory via the **Files** pane in the **MISC** window.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/see_files.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this information create a directory you will use for this course. This can be done outside of Rstudio or you can use the **Files pane** in the **MISC window**. Once this is created set your working directory to it. With that done we can go onto the next section.\n\n## Script editor\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/editor.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can quickly type and run code using the **console window**. However, to fully utilise Rstudio we will instead use the **script editor** in the **source window**. This allows us to reuse and edit code easier and it allows us to save our code so we can come back to it.\n\nIf you cannot see your **script editor**, click the multi window button on the top of the **source window** or **console window**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/script_editor_expand.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nType the below into the **script editor** and press **\"enter\"**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 2\n```\n:::\n\n\nPressing enter goes to a new line without running the command, just like other text editors (word, emails etc.).\n\nOn the new line type the below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n4 - 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Running commands\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/command.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can run a command that is in the script editor by one of the two following ways:\n\n-   Via cursor:\n\n    -   Move the cursor to the line you would like to run.\n    -   Press **\"Ctrl\" + \"enter\"** ( **\"cmd\"** + **\"enter\"** for Mac)\n\n-   Highlighting:\n\n    -   Highlight the parts you would like and press **\"Ctrl\" + \"enter\"** ( **\"cmd\"** + **\"enter\"** for Mac)\n    -   You can highlight a part of a line, a whole line, and even multiple lines.\n\nRun the commands you currently have in your **script editor**.\n\nThe **script editor** is unaffected with only the cursor moving if you used the cursor method. What is actually happening is that your commands are being copied to the **console window** and are being run there.\n\nI would encourage to primarily use the script editor to write your code. It is brilliant for editing, reusing, and documenting your code.\n\n### Annotations\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/hashtag.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnnotations can be added to your code in the **script editor**. If a line starts with a `#` it will not be run as a command, this line is then an annotation. This is extremely useful to leave information for your future self. It is much harder to go back to old code and figure out what it does if it is just code.\n\nBe a mate, annotate.\n\nEdit the contents of your **script editor** so it looks like the below. Then run all the lines.\n\n**Tip**: If you have selected the **script editor** you can use **\"Ctrl\"** + **\"a\"** to highlight all.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Command 1\n2 + 2\n#Command 2\n4 - 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Saving scripts\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/r_save.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, one of the best aspects of using the **script editor** is that you can save your scripts. I use this so I can have scripts for specific projects and template scripts for certain tasks I routinely carry out.\n\n-   To save a script you can click the floppy disk on the toolbar of the **source window**.\n-   To save as, go to the RStudio toolbar and click **\"File\"** \\> **\"Save As...\"**.\n\n### Open a saved script\n\nYou can open a previously saved script in 2 main ways:\n\n-   Via the **Files pane** in the **MISC window**\n\n    -   Navigate to the directory with the script (you do not need to set the working directory to this directory)\n    -   Click the name of the script you would like to open\n\n-   Via the Rstudio toolbar\n\n    -   Click **\"File\"**\n    -   Click **\"Open file\"**\n    -   With the popup browser navigate to the location of the script and open it\n\n### New script\n\nYou can have multiple scripts open at one time and switch between these scripts with the tabs at the top of the **script editor window**.\n\nTo create and open a new script, click on the button on the RStudio toolbar shown below and select **\"R script\"**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/new_script_button.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n",

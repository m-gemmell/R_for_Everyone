Ensure you are using annotations and code sections to keep the contents clear and separated.\n\nFor convenience the code to load the Penguin **data frame** directory will be:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguin_df <- read.csv(\"Chapter_13-16/penguin.tsv\", \n                      check.names = FALSE,\n                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE,\n                      sep = \"\\t\"\n                      )\n```\n:::\n\n\nYour plots might not look exactly the same. As long as your plot contains the same data it is good. If you are not sure if your plot is correct, feel free to look at the solutions to look at my code.\n\n## Line graph\n\nFirst we will ignore \"penguin_df\".\n\nCreate the below plot. You will need to create the **vectors** yourself.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](15-Plots_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Tip**: The x and y labels may help you figure out the commands to create the **vectors**.\n\n## Histogram\n\nFrom the \"penguin_df\" create the below plot:\n\n**Note**: The colour of the bars are \"blue\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](15-Plots_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scatterplot\n\nFrom the \"penguin_df\" create the below plot:\n\n**Note**: You can check what numbers refer to what shape for `pch =` at: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](15-Plots_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBefore you continue save this plot. Details below:\n\n-   Save the file as a png called \"Penguins_2009_bill_depth_vs_length_scatterplot.png\"\n-   Save the plot with a width and height of 250 and resolution of 150\n\n## Boxplot\n\nFrom the \"penguin_df\" create the below plot:\n\n**Note**: Make sure the x axis is in the same order as below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](15-Plots_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the last task, save this plot. Details below:\n\n-   Save the file as a jpg called \"Penguins_species_and_flipper_length_boxplot.jpg\" in \"Chapter_13-16\".\n-   Save the plot with a width of 300, height of 250, and resolution of 150\n",

knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/basic_stats.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

This week we'll learn how to carry out some basic stats. This will involve linear regressions and some t-tests.

Create and use the directory "Chapter_17-18" as the working directory for this chapter. Additionally create a new script called "Stats.R" for this chapter.

Before we continue just a reminder about annotations and code sections.

## Linear regression

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/linear_regression.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Linear regression is a method to model the relationship between two **numeric vectors**. Ultimately we want to produce the predictive equation:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where *m* is equal to the gradient and *c* is equal to the intercept. With this we can predict the value of *y* if we know the value of *x* and vice versa.

### Fish market dataset

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '30%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/bream.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Before getting to the analysis we need to read in the data. For this chapter we will be looking at the file **Fish.csv** which contains information of 7 common fish species sold in Fish markets (Source: <https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market>).

Download the file into your "Chapter_17-18" directory.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
download_link(
  link="https://m-gemmell.github.io/R_for_everyone/downloads/Fish.csv",
  button_label = "Download Fish.csv",
  button_type = "danger",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = TRUE
)
```

The columns for the data are:

-   **Species**: Species of fish ("Bream", "Roach", "Whitefish", "Parkki", "Perch", "Pike", and "Smelt").
-   **Weight**: Weight of the fish in grams.
-   **Length1**: Vertical length of the fish in centimetres.
-   **Length2**: Diagonal length of the fish in centimetres.
-   **Length3**: Cross length of the fish in centimetres.
-   **Height**: Height of the fish in centimetres.
-   **Width**: Diagonal width of the fish in centimetres.

The dataset is primarily interested in predicting the weight of a fish based on its length, height, or width.

First step is to **read** in the data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_df <- read.csv("Fish.csv", check.names = FALSE)
```

Have a look at the **data frame** and you'll see it looks pretty good with no `NA` values.

For now we only want to look at the information for the species Bream. Let's create a "bream_df":

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Create the data frame
bream_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Bream",]
#Check how many rows it has
nrow(bream_df)
```

We are left with 35 data points which should be plenty for our linear regression.

### Scatterplot

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Scatterplot_2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Before we carry out the linear regression we'll create a scatterplot of the two **vectors** we want to compare. For the first instance we will compare **Height** to **Length1** (vertical length).

In fact before we do, let's change the column name "Length1" to "v_length" so it is a bit more intuitive for us. Whilst we are at it we'll change the other length column names.

```{r eval=FALSE}
colnames(bream_df)[3:5] <- c("v_length", "d_length", "c_length")
```

Time to quickly plot "v_length" (x) against "Weight" (y):

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(x = bream_df$v_length, y = bream_df$Weight)
```

Super! That looks like a decently linear plot with a positive trend. We will therefore fit the linear model.

### Linear model

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/lm.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

We can fit a linear model with the **function** `lm()`. We simply provide the column names as a formula ( `y_column_name ~ x_column_name` ) similar to the `boxplot()` **function**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit <- lm(Weight~v_length, data=bream_df)
```

We can now add the linear model as a line to our plot with the **function** `abline()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
abline(fit)
```

With the line added we also want to add the linear equation to the plot. To do this we need to check the contents of the "fit" **variable** first so we know what to add.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit
```

You'll see the following two sections:

-   `Call:` Shows the **function** with options you ran to create "fit"

-   `Coefficients:`: This contains 2 parts

    -   `(Intercept)`: This is the intercept value of the linear model (*c*)
    -   `v_length`: This is the gradient values (*m*)

Our next step is to create a **string scalar** containing the linear equation. To do this we can extract the coefficients from the "fit" **object** like below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- fit$coefficients[2]
c <- fit$coefficients[1]
```

If you print out "m" and "c" to the console you'll notice they have a different number of decimal places than when displayed through printing "fit". We will therefore change these to 2 decimal places with the `round()` **function**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- round(m, digits = 2)
c <- round(c, digits = 2)
```

Now to use the `paste0()` **function** to create our linear equation as a **string scalar**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
linear_equation <- paste0("y = ", m , "x + ", c)
```

Finally we will recreate our plot, add the abline, and then add the linear equation. We will add the linear equation with the **function** `text()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(x = bream_df$v_length, y = bream_df$Weight)
abline(fit)
text(x = 30, y = 800, labels = linear_equation)
```

The `text()` options `x =` and `y =` normally require a bit of trial and error to set it in a nice location. This can be a bit fiddly but is made much easier by making the label smaller (e.g. making the numbers have a smaller amount of decimal places).

## t-test

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/scale.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

A t-test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

In this example we will compare the weights of the fish Bream, Parkki, and Roach. Therefore let's subset our **data frame** so we have three **data frames**, one for each species.

We already have a "bream_df" so we only need to make one for Parkki and one for Roach. Before we do we'll change the column names for "fish_df" like we did for "bream_df"

```{r eval=FALSE}
colnames(fish_df)[3:5] <- c("v_length", "d_length", "c_length")
parkki_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Parkki",]
roach_df <- fish_df[fish_df$Species == "Roach",]
```

### Boxplot

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/boxplot.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Before carrying out a t-test it can be useful to visualise the difference between groups with a boxplot.

Before we do this we need to combine the three **data frames** into one. This can be done by binding the rows with `rbind()`. This will combine two provided **data frames** which contain the same number of columns with the same column names.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Combine bream_df and parkki_df
fish_subset_df <- rbind(bream_df, parkki_df)
#Now rbind roach_df to our new df
fish_subset_df <- rbind(fish_subset_df, roach_df)
```

There is also `cbind` to combine **data frames** by columns. In this case the **data frames** need to have the same number of rows with the same order and names.

Time for a boxplot!

```{r eval=FALSE}
boxplot(Weight~Species, data = fish_subset_df)
```

We can clearly see that the weights of Parkki and Roach are very similar to each other but very different to Bream's weight.

### t-test comparison

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/five_percent.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Let us see if what we see visually is also visible statistically.

We can carry out a t-test with the **function** `t.test()`. Simply provide the **function** with the two **numerical vectors** you would like to compare.

```{r eval=FALSE}
bream_parkki_ttest <- t.test(bream_df$Weight, parkki_df$Weight)
bream_roach_ttest <- t.test(bream_df$Weight, roach_df$Weight)
parkki_roach_ttest <- t.test(parkki_df$Weight, roach_df$Weight)
```

Print the resulting **variables** to the console and you will see a lot of information. I am sure all these values can say a lot about the data but we are only interested in the p-values.

In this case we can say the means between the two groups tested are significantly different if the p-value is less than 0.05 (1 in 20).

It can be a bit annoying to have to look through the `t.test()` output for each result so we'll create a **vector** to contain the p-values for comparisons against Bream.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_species_weight_ttests <- c(
  bream_parkki_ttest$p.value,
  bream_roach_ttest$p.value
)
```

This is pretty useful but we can't immediately see which comparison each t-test is equal to. Thankfully just like **data frames** have row and column names, **vectors** can have names for each element.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Add the vector names
names(fish_species_weight_ttests) <- 
  c("bream_vs_parkki","bream_vs_roach")
#Look at the vector with the added names
fish_species_weight_ttests
```

We can then index the **vector** through the names.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Access the p-value of Bream against Roach
fish_species_weight_ttests["bream_vs_roach"]
#Add the p-value of Parkki against Roach
fish_species_weight_ttests["parkki_vs_roach"] <- 
  parkki_roach_ttest$p.value
```

With our nice **vector** of p-values we can quickly see where the p-value is less than 0.05 (i.e. the means are significantly different) and where it is higher (i.e. the means aren't significantly different).

```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_species_weight_ttests < 0.05
```

Do these p-values match what you saw in the boxplot?

## Some more useful functions

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/r_toolbox.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

### Summary

The **function** `summary()` can give you some quick summary information for each column of a **data frame**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(fish_df)
```

This gives you some nice information for your numerical columns:

-   `Min.`: The minimum number
-   `1st Qu.`: The 25th quartile
-   `Median`: The median (Middle sorted number)
-   `Mean`: The average
-   `3rd Qu.`: The 75th quartile
-   `Max.`: The maximum number

You will notice the information given for the "Species" column is not very informative as it is a **character** column. However, this would be a lot more descriptive if it was a **factor**.

Therefore we'll change the "Species" column to a **factor** and run `summary()` again.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fish_df$Species <- as.factor(fish_df$Species)
summary(fish_df)
```

Now `summary()` shows how many instances of each species is present in the **data frame**.

For future cases it may better to use `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` with the `read.csv()` **function** when we first read in the file.

### Table

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/table_ikea.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

The `table()` **function** will provide a **vector** containing the number of instances for each **level** in a **factor**. This is pretty much what `summary()` did to a **factor**.

However, unlike `summary()` it will also do this for **characters** and **numerics**.

**Note**: Remember to use the **"Help"** pane if you are not sure what a **function** does.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Table command for columns from fish_df
table(fish_df$Species)
table(as.character(fish_df$Species))
table(fish_df$Height)
table(floor(fish_df$Height))
table(as.integer(fish_df$Height))
#Run table on various numeric vectors
table(1:10)
table(1:100 * 0)
table(1:100 %% 2)
table(seq(from = 0, to = 50, by = 0.5) %% 7.5)
table(c(1:9,1:8,1:7,1:6,1:5,1:4,1:3,1:2,1))
#Table will run on logicals too
table(1:100 > 50)
table(c("a","a","b","c") == "a")
#Create a vector of 20 random numbers between 0 and 10
random_num_vec <- sample(0:10, size = 20, replace = TRUE )
#table
table(random_num_vec)
#Create a character vector randomly containing 1-10 of the strings
#"Book", "TV", and "Film" each
random_char_vec <- c(
  rep("Book", sample(1:10, size = 1)),
  rep("TV", sample(1:10, size = 1)),
  rep("Film", sample(1:10, size = 1))
)
#Now for table()
table(random_char_vec)
#Can create a quick bar plot with the output from table()
barplot(table(random_char_vec))
```

A few more **functions** were introduced above. I will let you explore them yourself or you can ask me verbally.
